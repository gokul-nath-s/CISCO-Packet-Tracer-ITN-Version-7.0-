## Overview

This repository contains the labs and projects completed during the CISCO (Introduction to Networks Version 7.0) course. Through this course, I have achieved a student-level credential for completing CCNAv7: Introduction to Networks and acquired the following capabilities:

- Configure switches and end devices to provide access to local and remote network resources.
- Explain how physical and data link layer protocols support the operation of Ethernet in a switched network.
- Configure routers to enable end-to-end connectivity between remote devices.
- Create IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes and verify network connectivity between devices.
- Explain how the upper layers of the OSI model support network applications.
- Configure a small network with security best practices.
- Troubleshoot connectivity in a small network.

In today’s world, technical literacy is more important than ever, and Cisco is proud to provide the knowledge and skills necessary to build and maintain digital networks. Keep up the great work and best wishes for continued future success.
